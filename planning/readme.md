# App Description

This app will act as a database for potential vacations. In the time leading up to a trip, I'll normally collect places I want to go in different places (phone, email, etc.) but it would be nice to have everything in one place. That way, when I'm on a trip, everything will be organized and it'll be easy to reference.
