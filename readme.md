# Project 2

# Full Stack Web Application: _[Wanderlist](https://the-wanderlist.herokuapp.com/)_

A simple trivia game about the 2nd best player on the Cleveland Cavaliers, Kevin Love. The game starts when the browser loads and the player selects their answer, submits it, and is directed to the next question where they will be informed if their guess is right or wrong.

## Technologies Used:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Express
* Mongoose
* Handlebars
* Adobe Photoshop

## Approach Taken:

I thought of the app with me and my friends in mind. We always find interesting places to check out whenever we're planning on traveling but I tend to have links and notes everywhere between post-its, my phone and in my email. So, I thought it would be cool to have an app have everything in one place.

My initial vision was to create a trip, and inside of the trip you could add restaurants and places to go. I was having some difficulty in so for the sake of time, I decided to switch gears and make things simpler, but still organized. I decided to sort each individual entry by location to keep everything grouped together.

For the design, I wanted to keep things clean and simple but still visually appealing.

## Installation Instructions:

None, app loads in the browser

## Unsolved Problems:

The project works, but I didn't get to build it the way I originally wanted to so I want to go back and try again on my own time!
